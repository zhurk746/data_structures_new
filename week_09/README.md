This week I set up a sensorData table using PostgreSQL in order to have my sensorData continuously stored in a database. 
I plan to eventually analyze this sensorData and determine how much the temperature fluctuates in my kitchen when my roommates or I are cooking. 
I used the pm2 module in order to have my database be populated on a continuous basis and modified the starter code with my credentials for my particle deviceID and access token.
