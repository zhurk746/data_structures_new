Steps Taken:
1- I reviewed the weekly assignment instructions and final assignment and decided to put together a blog about restaurants I had visited in NYC.
<br /> 2- I reviewed the started code provided and decided that I would change the code so that, it would reflect the dates I visited a particular restuarant,
the restaurant name, whether or not I enjoyed the experience and the list of items I ate at the restaurant. I figured this would be 
a great way to eventually provide friends or visitors to NYC with a list of restaurant recommendations and would be very fun to put together as well as, 
more and more restaurants begin to offer indoor and outdoor dining options. 
<br /> 3- I then modified the started code with several of the restuarants I have visted in the last few weeks and what I had ordered. 
<br /> 4- I input this data into the blogEntries array. 
<br /> 5- I then ran the async eachSeries function over all of my blogEntries in order to input them into the Dynamodb. 
<br /> 6- I plan to continue to add data entries into the Dynamodb database throughout the semester with information about restaurants I visit over the next few months.
