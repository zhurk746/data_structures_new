For Part One of the Assignment, I wanted to select all the data that I will eventually have in my aalocations map.
<br /> I wanted to show that I was using at least the SELECT, FROM and WHERE statements in the SQL query.
<br /> After taking a look at all of the addresses I noted that all of them had a Latitude greater than 40. 
<br /> So, I including a latitude greater than 40 condition in the WHERE clause of my SQL query. 
<br /> For Part Two of the assignment, I wanted to return all of the entries within my process blog that is currently a running list of restaurants I've visited after moving back to NYC. 
<br /> In my final assignment, I hope to show the running list of restaurants within the process blog so I used the async module to query all elements of my dynamoDB database.
<br /> To do this, I first created a variable that contained an array of all of the primary keys in my dynamoDB so that the async module would iterate over this variable. 
<br /> Refer to the screenshot within this folder for reference that the query in fact, brought back all elements within my dynamoDb.
