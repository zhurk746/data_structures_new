For the week 1 assignment, I noticed that the only difference in each .html file was the number in the filename.

I first wrote code that had 10 different requests, one for each file name (refer to week1_bruteforce.js).

I then changed it to a for loop, where the for loop provided an index equal to the index in the file name, formatted that index into a string value matching the file name, and then wrapped the callback function in another function to preserve the value of index of the file name (refer to week1_forloop.js).
